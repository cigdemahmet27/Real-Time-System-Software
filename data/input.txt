# --- SETUP ---
# Server (Implicit): Capacity=2, Period=5.
# Server Priority: High (Period 5 < Period 10)

# --- PERIODIC TASK ---
# Task 1: Period 10, Execution 5.
# Runs from 0-5 normally.
P 0 5 10 10

# --- APERIODIC TASK ---
# Arrives at T=2.
#
# WHY THIS IS A GOOD TEST:
# 1. At T=0, Server checks queue -> Empty. 
#    - If Poller: It would burn budget and sleep.
#    - If Deferrable: It PRESERVES budget.
#
# 2. At T=2, Task arrives.
#    - Periodic Task 1 is currently running.
#    - Deferrable Server says "Wait! I still have budget!"
#    - Server INTERRUPTS (Preempts) Task 1 immediately.
