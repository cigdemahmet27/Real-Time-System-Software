# 1. Periodic Task (Low Priority)
#    Released at 0, Exec 10, Period 20
P 0 10 20 20

# 2. Aperiodic Task (Target for the Server)
#    Arrives at Time 2, Exec 1.
#    Note: Since our Server Period is 5 (Hardcoded in Scheduler.cpp), 
#    and Poller checks at T=0, it will miss this arrival!
#    It should wait until T=5 to run.
